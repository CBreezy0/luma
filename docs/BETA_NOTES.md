# Beta Notes

## Supported Devices
- iPhone only

## Known Issues
- Some 3rd-party iOS plugins emit deprecation warnings on build (StoreKit/iOS 18).
- Splash sizing may need tuning on very small devices if the wordmark feels too large.

## Feedback Focus
- Preset quality and naming (do they feel premium?)
- UI feel and navigation smoothness (gallery → editor, tabs, sliders)
- Export reliability and output quality
